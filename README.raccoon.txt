The name of the main processing script for this assignment is Evaluate_Raccoon_Life.py. The subsidiary file def_utils.py is also included, which defines the header block, calulates average, cumulative sum, and euclidian distance of all elements through a specified list. 

The processing being completed by the two scripts outlined above reads in data from the '2008male0006.txt' file, stores data elements in a dictionary, converts elemenets to correct data type, and compute average, sum, euclidean distance between coordiante points of fictional raccoon 'George'. It outputs to the file 'Georges_life.txt', which is quite grim. 

Input file: 2008male0006.txt
Output file: Georges_life.txt
